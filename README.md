# Space Travelers' Hub

> In this project, the real live data from the SpaceX API is used to build a web application for a fictious company that provides commercial and scientific space travel services. The application allows users to book rockets and join selected space missions.
> The Rockets section displays a list of all available SpaceX rockets. Users can book each rocket by clicking the reservation button or cancel the previously made booking.
> The Missions section displays a list of current missions along with their brief description and participation status. There is also a button next to each mission that allows users to join the selected mission or leave the mission the user joined earlier.
